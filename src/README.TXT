DESCRIPTION
===========

TracExplorer combines an VSTrac, an Viusal Studio Trac integration, and TSVNTrac, an Trac-Bugtraqprovider for TortoiseSVN.  
 * VSTrac is an addin for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.
 * TSVNTrac uses the bugtraq-interface provided by TortoiseSVN, the best userinterface for subversion on windows (http://www.tortoisesvn.net).
TracExplorer allows the integration with Trac (http://trac.edgewall.com/) systems using the XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin). It allows configuring many servers, querying, modifying and adding new tickets as well as editing wiki pages.
